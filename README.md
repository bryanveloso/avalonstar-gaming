Gaming on Avalonstar
====================

One of my first Django applications was a Dance Dance Revolution session tracker
that accompanied version 24 of Avalonstar (the old .com). Much has changed since
2009 with the advent of web APIs for games. In the spirit of tracking progress
and having fun with the resulting data, gaming tracking returns to Avalonstar.
